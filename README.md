Information regarding Coronavirus outbreak 2019
There have been 2 reports in the past week about the prevalence of Coronavirus Wuhan in the general population.(http://dmna.ny.gov/covid19/docs/all/DOH_COVID19_AntibodyTestingFactSheet_041420.pdf and https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463v1). There are reports regarding these studies https://www.foxnews.com/media/coronavirus-death-rate-flu-jay-bhattacharya, but the conclusions are  misrepresented. If the results of these studies are use to make the statistics for hospitalization rate and death rate lower than they really are, then governmental leaders might make a mistake when they decide to open up our society.  
 
The Stanford study is reported on Foxnews website as showing: "We figured out about somewhere between 2.8 and 4 percent of Santa Clara County has had evidence of COVID infection," continued Bhattacharya, describing the results of his preliminary report that has not been peer-reviewed.
"If 4 percent have evidence of infection that means that there's about 85 times more people who've had it per person than actually identified having it,"
 
The New York study is reported by NBC New York news ( https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/new-york-virus-deaths-top-15k-cuomo-expected-to-detail-plan-to-fight-nursing-home-outbreaks/2386556/ ) as showing 13.9% of people tested in a New York COVID-19 antibody study tested positive, meaning they had the virus, Cuomo says; that means up to 2.7 million people could have been infected statewide.
 
If you look at the data http://dmna.ny.gov/covid19/docs/all/DOH_COVID19_AntibodyTestingFactSheet_041420.pdf * Note:A reactive result may be due to past or present infection with non-SARS-CoV-2strains. However, specificity for the Wadsworth Center (WC) SARS-CoV-2 IgG test has been determined to be within 93 to 100%. Therefore, significant cross-reactivity to other known respiratory viruses is not expected.
 
What this means is that between 0% and 7% of the people who tested “positive” on this study were positive because they had a coronavirus infection due to one of the other corona viruses (There are 6 or more coronaviruses mentioned in these CDC articles: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/general-information.html and https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html ). The last reference states “People around the world commonly get infected with human coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1.” I don’t know if this means 50%, 25% or 75%, but it is common. There are 19.5 million people in New York State, and 21 million in the New York Metropolitan area. If you take the average of 0% and 7%, that is about 3.5%. If we estimate that 50% of the people in New York were previously  infected by a coronavirus, notCOVID-19, then 3.5% of 10 million people would test positive, or about 350,000 people. 
 
In the Stanford study, https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463v1 you can find the Results section at https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463v1.full.pdf+html
which mentions that “Among 371 pre-COVID samples, 369 were negative.” Also, the author states “our estimates of specificity are 99.5%”. 2 positive cases out of 371 negative samples is about 0.5%. This is in the hands of the manufacturer of the test, by which we usually mean that the tests were done using the most standardised, ideal sample collection and handling methods. That’s why tests need to be done under “field” conditions, not just laboratory conditions. The population of Santa Clara County is roughly 2 million. If we assume 50% of the population has been exposed to non-COVID-19 coronaviruses, that would be about 1 million persons. 0.5% of 1 million would be 50,000. The authors of the study estimate the prevalence of the virus between 1.8 and 5.7%. There is a caveat in the Discussion of the report, namely 
“but recognize that new information, especially about the test kit performance, could result in updated estimates. For example, if new estimates indicate test specificity to be less than 97.9%, our SARS-CoV-2 prevalence estimate would change from 2.8% to less than 1%, and the lower uncertainty bound of our estimate would include zero”.


Whenever someone presents you with statistics, you need to compare the statistics with reality. If the number of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases is as high as the 2 above papers indicate, then why would a large number of nursing home patients be dying? Also, why would the New York hospitals be full? It might be that if you use non-COVID-19 cases to increase the denominator, this makes the hospitalization and mortality rates lower than they really are.
